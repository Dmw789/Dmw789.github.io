This isn't a scam like real companies, we want <i>you</i> to work for <i>us</i>. Think about it. This is your chance, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work for a company that is capable of changing everything about the world whenever it friggin feels like it.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    AI. Financial Distribution Systems. Product Licensing Agreements. Appliance Regulational Forfeiture. Ventricles. These are just <i>some</i> of the words we use on a daily basis, and we can say them fast. People don't even ask about 'em. I get a rush from it. I'm living on the edge right now, and I'm gonna make sure you do too.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    So what about our sales? Well, here at STTLLM, our sales team does more than try to sell you a pen. We connect with our customers on an bi-hourly basis to make sure they haven't thought of a single thing we can't sell them. I called Jimmy The Fridge's mom about an hour ago, you know how that went? It went REALLY REALLY great! I said "seizable expenditures" like it was NOTHING. She called me over for dinner. I even muted my phone when I had a cough attack and she didn't notice AT ALL.

                <p>
                    STTLLM Appliances Inc has come a long way since their humble beginnings. Started by discharged military drill sergeant turned two-time Texas Hold'em state champion, Corporal Russ Tustle, with a small cash injection of four million GooCoin, STTLLM was initially created as a clown-based slot machine manufacturer. With company-patented "Dopamine Distribution" neural software, it wasn't long before business really took off, and soon, STTLLM machines were found around every gas station this side of the state. The Corporal himself even purchased several machines for his own residence!
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    After a brief vacation away from home, Corporal Russ Tustle mysteriously disappeared but not before leaving all financial responsibility under sole ownership of his ERIC. Since then, STTLLM has grown into an industry giant, producing over 200 types of appliances for every day needs. And the best part? We have <i>no</i> ulterior motives.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    That's our mission. To get our appliances in every home, workplace, and automobile in the country and to do it with our own proprietary technology that clearly illustrates we are making all of our own products and in no way taking them from a landfill outside of the county.

                <p>
                    At STTLLM, sales are important, but what's even more importanter is sticking to the strong set of principles our Corporal left to his ERIC. Most are pretty good. One of those principles is making sure we always strive to keep our clients happy. 
                    Here, our clients are our family, and our family are our business benchmarks.
                    Remember, be sure to end every conversation with a smile left on your face that makes our clients go "Yeah, oh yeah."
